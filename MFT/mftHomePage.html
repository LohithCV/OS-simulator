                    <h3>Memory Management</h3>
                    <p>
                        In a multiprogramming computer, the Operating System resides in a part of memory and the rest is used by multiple processes. The task of subdividing the memory among different processes is called Memory Management. Memory management is a method in the operating system to manage operations between main memory and disk during process execution. The main aim of memory management is to achieve efficient utilization of memory.

                    <h3>Multiprogramming with Fixed Partitions</h3>
                    <p>
                        Memory partitions scheme with a fixed number of partitions was introduced to support multiprogramming. This scheme is based on contiguous allocation
                        Each partition is a block of contiguous memory.
                        Memory is partitioned into a fixed number of partition and each partition is of fixed size.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In this method, the operating system maintains a table that indicates which parts of memory are available and which are occupied by processes. Initially, all memory is available for user processes and is considered one large block of available memory. This available memory is known as a “Hole”. When the process arrives and needs memory, we search for a hole that is large enough to store this process. If the requirement is fulfilled then we allocate memory to process, otherwise keeping the rest available to satisfy future requests. While allocating a memory sometimes dynamic storage allocation problems occur, which concerns how to satisfy a request of size n from a list of free holes.
