                    <h3>Memory Management</h3>
                    <p>
                        In a multiprogramming computer, the Operating System resides in a part of memory and the rest is used by multiple processes. The task of subdividing the memory among different processes is called Memory Management. Memory management is a method in the operating system to manage operations between main memory and disk during process execution. The main aim of memory management is to achieve efficient utilization of memory.

                    <h3>Multiprogramming with Variable Partitions</h3>
                    <p>
                      It is a part of Contiguous allocation technique. It is used to alleviate the problem faced by Fixed Partitioning. In contrast with fixed partitioning, partitions are not made before the execution or during system configure. Various features associated with variable Partitioning-
                      <ul>
                        <li>RAM is empty and partitions are made during the run-time according to process's need instead of partitioning during system configure.</li>

                        <li>The size of partition will be equal to incoming process.</li>

                        <li>The partition size varies according to the need of the process so that the internal fragmentation can be avoided to ensure efficient utilisation of RAM.</li>

                        <li>Number of partitions in RAM is not fixed and depends on the number of incoming process and Main Memory's size.</li>

Once a suitable block is found, the operating system splits the block into two parts: the portion that will be allocated to the process, and the remaining free block.
